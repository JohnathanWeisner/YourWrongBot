YourWrongBot
============

Contributors: Christine, Adam, Keaty, Brendan, Johnathan

made a Snootie Reddit Grammar Bot (ironic misspelling intended). It uses the Snoo gem to retrieve and parse Reddit comments, then passes text content to the Gingerice gem which generates spelling and grammar corrections as necessary; YourWrongBot then posts a reply to the original comment with corrections. YourWrongBot also has a "personality", which is not as snooty as you'd think. ...maybe a little bit.

How to use: it pretty much runs itself. Requires Snoo gem and Gingerice gem. Upvote our comments on Reddit when you see them.

How to contribute: fork it, make it faster, better, stronger
